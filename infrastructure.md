## Infrastructure as Code

### Principles

1. Single source of truth.
1. Separate configuration from code.
1. Test backup restoration.
1. Whole team needs familiarity with the tools used.
1. Clarity can override other concerns, increases security (KISS).
1. Complexity vs benefits received.
1. Less is more, especially regarding code maintenance cost.
1. Risk = Impact * probability.
